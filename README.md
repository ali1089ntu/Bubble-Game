# Bubble-Game
A Bubble Game is developed using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Different bubbles with random values is showing on the screen. Above the bubbles, there is a div with three boxes. One box is showing a Hit Value, one is showing a timer that starts from 60 seconds and last box is showing a score (Headings are mentioned along side the boxes). Random Values are coming in the hit box. When you click on the bubble with the same value as displaying in the hit box your score increases by 10 and values in the bubble and the hit box changes again. If you click on the wrong bubble whose value is not same as the value in the hit box, then the bubbles will automatically disappears and it shows a message that the Game is Over! and also displays total score of your's and the timer will also stopped. As told earlier, the timer starts from 60 seconds and decreases automatically. When the timer is 0, the bubbles will disappears automatically and it shows a message that Time is Over! and displays the total score of your's. So, this is how the bubble game actually runs.
